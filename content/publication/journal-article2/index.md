abstract: This paper is part of a two part submission that synthesizes elements from case studies presented in Quigley et al., (2019). The aim of this paper is to develop a more holistic understanding of how earth science was used to support diverse examples of decision-making. My contribution is a case study of the Great Barrier Reef, where I provided my personal views on how science was solicited and received by stakeholders.
