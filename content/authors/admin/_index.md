I am a research Statistician in CSIRO Data61. I have a PhD in applied statistics, focussing more recently on quantifying and communicating uncertainty to decision-makers, the development of non-linear space-time analytics that utilises machine learning algorithms for environmental problems, investigating elicitation practices with experts on risk related issues and the translation and synthesis of expert opinion into priors to inform Bayesian models. I am part of the STEM professionals in schools program and enjoy interacting with schools to get students interested in mathematics, statistics and computing.
